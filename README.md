#3D to do list

###The purpose of this application was to make a more engaging to do list for people to interact with, and with more development, be a person virtual hub for people to manage their daily lives.

To activate camera controls, click and the screen and press control. Remember to place your cursor at the center of the screen, or else it becomes difficult to click models accurately.

Click on the orb, and click on one of the to do list types. Then, click anywhere on the ground to make a model that represents that type of to do list appear.

To rotate models, press shift. If you want to look at your to do lists again, press the back tick button or ~ button
